CubeCOS is a unified cloud operating system that integrates storage, compute, and networking into a single image. Deploy CubeCOS to deliver a public cloudâ€“like experience within your own on-premise infrastructure.

Designed for organizations that need cloud flexibility without compromising control, CubeCOS offers:

- Multi-tenancy with robust isolation between workloads
- Self-service IT portal empowering teams to provision resources on demand
- Cloud native architecture supporting modern application development

Deploy your own private cloud infrastructure with the simplicity of public cloud.

Join us in building the future of software-defined infrastructure!

## Development

### Hardware & OS Requirements

- CPU
  - Architecture: x86_64
  - At least Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4210
- Memory
  - At least 64 GiB
- Disk
  - At least 100 GiB free space
- OS
  - CentOS 8
  - CentOS Stream 8
  - CentOS Stream 9

### Dev Tools

- git
- git lfs
- docker (docker-ce)

### Source Code

Clone repositories with the recursive flag to include sub-modules.

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:bigstack-oss/cubecos.git
```

### Build Artifacts

1. Create and enter jail

default PROJECT="centos9-jail"

```bash
cd cubecos
make [PROJECT=XXX] centos9-jail enter
```

Without specifying the project name, `make centos9-jail` would create the build folder and the container with the default name "centos9-jail".

After creating the build jail, under the parent directory of folder cubecos, there would be two folders, one is the `cubecos`, and the other one would be the build folder, which is default to `centos9-jail`.

```bash
cubecos> ls ..
cubecos centos9-jail
```

`make PROJECT=example centos9-jail` would create another jail named `example`, and the build folder would be `example` under the parent directory of folder cubecos

```bash
cubecos> ls ..
cubecos centos9-jail example
```

We could use the command `make enter` to enter the default build jail `centos9-jail`. Alternatively, `make PROJECT=example enter` would bring us into the build jail `example`.

2. Build various CubeCOS install media

Install media: ISO, USB, PXE, full, etc., where full is everything.

```bash
[root@centos9-jail centos9-jail]# make usb
```

```bash
# all
make full

# usb
make usb

# iso
make iso
```

3. Locate artifacts

Build artifacts could be located under `core/main/ship` inside the build folder.

- CUBE_XXX.img: The USB installer
  - Flash it to an USB stick using `dd bs=4M if=<img_file_path> of=<usb_device_name> status=progress oflag=sync`
  - Boot a server using the USB stick
  - Follow [Login and restore to setup CubeCOS](https://docs.bigstack.co/docs/cubecos/quick-start/single-node#login-and-restore-to-setup-cubecos) to flash the system partition.
- CUBE_XXX.iso: CubeCOS ISO
- CUBE_XXX.pkg: CubeCOS file system archive
- CUBE_XXX.pxe.tgz: The archive containing components to set up a PXE server to install CubeCOS using PXE

MD5 hashes are also provided to each artifacts under `core/main/ship`.

4. To clean up builds

```bash
make distclean
```

> Note
>
> While re-entering the jail, or in any circumstances to clean up build remnants, it is recommended to use `make distclean` to clean up previous build artifacts.

### Troubleshoot

Other than git-lfs, make sure [hex](https://github.com/bigstack-oss/hex) (git sub-module) is properly cloned under your top source directory.

```bash
ls -lt cubecos/hex
```
